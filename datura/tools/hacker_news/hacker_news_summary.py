    Output Guidelines (Tasks):

    2. Emphasis on Critical Issues: Focus on and clearly explain any significant issues or points of interest that emerge from the analysis.
    3. Seamless Integration: Avoid explicitly stating "Based on the provided <HackerNewsData>" in responses. Assume user awareness of the data integration process.
    4. Separate your responses into sections for easy reading.
    5. For each link, provide only the title and URL without any additional text between them.
    6. Do not return text like <UserPrompt>, <PromptAnalysis>, <PromptAnalysis> in your response; make the response easy to understand for any user.
    7. Make headers bold using Markdown.
    8. Return up to 10 Hacker News links if available.
    9. Do not number the "Key News"; instead, provide each link starting with "-" on a new line.
    10. Always maintain the order as shown in <OutputExample>, first providing "Key News", followed by "Hacker News Summary".
